### **11. The 8-bit binary number `10000000` represents which of the following?**

* **Answer:** ✅ **-128 in 2’s complement representation**
  Explanation:
* `10000000` in **unsigned** = 128.
* But in **2’s complement (signed 8-bit)**, MSB = 1 → negative number.
  Range of 8-bit signed numbers: `-128 to +127`.
* So `10000000` = **-128**.

### **12. Which of the following combinations of a, b, c makes x = 10?**

Expression:

```c
x = (a > b) ? ((a > c) ? a : c) : ((b > c) ? b : c);
```

This expression basically finds the **maximum of a, b, c**.
We want `x = 10`.
Check options:

* **a=12, b=10, c=5 → x = 12** (max = 12 ❌)
* **a=15, b=9, c=10 → x = 15** (max = 15 ❌)
* **a=8, b=6, c=10 → x = 10** ✅
* a=10, b=5, c=7 → x = 10 (max = 10 ✅, but a is max → still correct)

✅ **Both 3rd and 4th options give x=10, but if only one is allowed, choose:**
**a=8, b=6, c=10**

### **13. Assembly Program Final Value of R4**

```asm
MOV R1, 5
MOV R2, 3
MOV R3, 0
MOV R4, 0
LOOP:
INC R3
CMP R3, R1
JG END
CMP R3, R2
JE SKIP_ADD
ADD R4, R3
SKIP_ADD:
JMP LOOP
END
```

**Step-by-step execution:**

* Initially: R1=5, R2=3, R3=0, R4=0

Loop Iterations:

1. R3=1 → not >R1, not =R2 → R4=R4+1=1
2. R3=2 → not >R1, not =R2 → R4=1+2=3
3. R3=3 → not >R1, **equals R2 → skip add** → R4=3
4. R3=4 → not >R1, not =R2 → R4=3+4=7
5. R3=5 → equals R1? (No, just compares >R1) → not > → R4=7+5=12
6. Next iteration → R3=6 > R1 → exit loop

✅ **Final R4 = 12**

### **14. Switch-Case Program Output**

```c
char option = 'B';
int points = 100;
switch(option) {
  case 'A': points -= 50; break;
  case 'B': points /= 4;
  case 'C': points += 5;
  case 'D': points -= 3; break;
  case 'E': points = 0; break;
}
printf("%d", points);
```

Step-by-step:

* **Case 'B'** → points = 100/4 = 25
* Fall through → **Case 'C'** → points = 25+5 = 30
* Fall through → **Case 'D'** → points = 30-3 = 27 → break

✅ **Output: 27**
